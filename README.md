programming in basic

this mainly is for the ti83 calculators, the ti83 can be programmed in basic or z80 assembly
currently the ti83 programs are in text files not the special ti format since i dont have the connector cable yet.

DEMOS?

there is probably a way to collect up various asm routines and reuse them.
write a basic wrapper which will act as the driver for the routines.
then call the compiled asm programs for  the driver.
