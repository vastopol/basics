programming in basic

this mainly is for the ti83 calculators, the ti83 can be programmed in basic or z80 assembly
currently the ti83 programs are in text files not the special ti format since i dont have the connector cable yet.

also experimenting with other versions of basic:
* brandy basic (bbc basic V)
* bwbasic
* basic256
